This is Version 2.1 of my platformer/speedrun game S-Cargo. 

The ideal version of this game in my mind draws close to games like those of the Dadish series in terms of overall structure and design, while maintaining a more complex set of movement options for players to explore and master like Super Mario Odyssey.

As the game is currently designed, the more advanced movement mechanic is not mandatory in its use, although that will certainly change. The foundational ideas of the game are as follows:

1. Collect all the mail as fast as you can
2. Get to the mailbox as fast as you can

In terms of tools players have at their disposal to achieve this, they have two distinct sets of movement options
1: Slither/crawl mode: players move slowly, but they can stick to all 4 orientations of surfaces, allowing player to tranverse over large obstacles. However, in this form, they are vulnerable to hazards, which if they make contact with, they will be hurt, which temporarily slow them down. This form is also slower than the secondary form: rolling. Players can access the secondary form of movement by retreating into their shell, which imposes a short movement delay and then moving.

2: Roll/shell mode: players can retreat into their shell and roll around the map, which has unique advantages. They are immune to all current forms of hazard damage, and can move quicker through the air when jumping. However, being in their shell, players can no longer stick to walls, and thus must leave rolling mode if they'd like to stick to a wall or the ceiling. Players can leave rolling mode by coming to a stop. 

In my opinion, the success of this game hinges on having levels that leverages the advantages and disadvantages of these two movement options in interesting, yet intuitive ways. 

Currently, there are 7 playable characters implemented with 3 distinct levels. 
I intend to continue making levels for the game, and eventually publish it. 

In terms of where to take this game in the future, here's my wishlist: 
1. More levels and level mechanics:
    My ideal target would be 30 levels divided into three worlds: the Verdant Valley, the Misty Mines, and the Crystal Caverns. I'll need to introduce more mechanics that engage with the movement options. I've tinkered with adding underwater currents and moving platforms, but these do not sufficiently engage with the movement options as is in my opinion. 
       A current shortlist of ideas include:
           A treadmill that can provide power to other mechanics in the overworld, that players can only move by being in the rolling form.
   
           Tunnels that players are only short enough to enter in rolling form, especially tunnels that introduce sloped surfaces, such that players can enter from one orientation but cannot re-enter where they exit due to the exit being too high or on the ceiling.
   
           Limited time events, like buttons that open doors for short periods of time, such that to complete the level at all, players will have to consider how to move more quickly. This reinforces the idea of going quickly even for casual players.
   
          "Chewable" obstacles/platforms, visibly made of leaves, that players chew through in their slither form. This provides a opportunity for the players to modify the level design itself while roaming, such that they can take advantage of their changes for a quicker return. Imagine climbing a tall section with grass platforms that they will have to navigate back down from, but the chewing allows them to quickly drop if they took the time to clear a way while climbing up. My only concern is that the snail's movement mechanics is not designed to be in small spaces, even corners, which I've largely resolved, still sometimes have weird interactions with jumping and orientations. However, if the chewable obstacles are purely thin platforms, that should not be an issue.
               
2. Hubworld:
   To build upon the three worlds concept, I'd like a topdown hubworld to physically navigate through each world to each level, such that the player has a good idea of the world's layout by the end of the game. The idea is that in every level, you deliver the mail to a unique recipient, so by the end of the game, players will associate the recipients of the mail to each world, forming a coherent unit of denizens in each one.
   
3. More consistent pixel art:
   I've gotten much better at pixel art since I first started this project in 2021, and the consistency in art style in this game bothers me. The pixel per unit is not even consistent, and that's on top of inconsistencies in character and menu design.
   
4. Phone app build:
   I think this game could do well, perhaps even better, as a phone app. It's a small game, and I think that's expected more often from phone games. The control scheme would have to be redesigned, in addition to many other things, so this would be a  big step. Given that the movement scheme is meant to be complex, its implementation in a phone app form would be tricky. Ideally, I'd like to fill out the game first, and then consider this more thoroughly once it's closer to being complete. 

I have more ideas and more things I'd like to add, but even the first three items are pretty significant as is, so I'll try to keep my scope more limited for now. I have other projects as well, so I know I'll be occupied elsewhere now and again.
